Firstly, it is worth noting that Dublin International's ICAO code is EIDW. This is obtainable from a simple google search.

In the image file of the cockpit, we can observe that the flight computer is also in view. In it contains waypoints, specifically:

BREKI
BASLU
PEKUS

When simply searching these waypoints into google, we get multiple results showcasing routes to the airport BIKF. We can also verify this by manually plotting these waypoints, which results in a nearly identical match to (a portion of) the EIDW -> BIKF route

From there, we can simply look up the information along with the airport we found. Something such as "BIKF to EIDW December 30 2024 Gate 104".

From there, we're greeted with this flight. Given how the plane took off at the same time this plane landed, the time would be 11:28 AM GMT.

So, the flag is jctfv{BIKF-11:28:AM}
