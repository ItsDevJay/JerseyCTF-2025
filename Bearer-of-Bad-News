Bearer-of-Bad-News (Web Exploitation)

Sign in with the credentials:
Username: user Password: ihavebadnews

Once signed in look at request headers and you'll notice a JWT token starting with 'ey'

From the URL secret you get a secret key for signing the JWT token (without this you will be faced with 'the cake is fake' meaning that your JWT is not valid and not signed

Used cyberchef to validate the JWT token by copy and pasting the headers and body and then changing the admin status from false to true

From there replace the JWT token and your in! CTF Complete.
