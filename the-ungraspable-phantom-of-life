Solution Steps

    The docker image discovered in the previous challenge must be used to solve this challenge.
    The actual solution steps are simple: Inspect the docker image. 
    Start by pulling it, and running it, then find things out of place.
    The first flag is hidden within /home/GF7/.ssh/authorized_keys amongst a few dozen other keys.
    The actual flag is hidden within the ssh-key hidden on the docker image.
    NOTE: THEY NEED THE PRIVATE KEY FOR THE NEXT CHALLENGE!!!
    Some custom binaries are on here as well, but ultimately that's just misdirection.
    The second flag is hidden in an ENV variable that wasn't listed in the dockerfile.
    To access that, you can type printenv or env or echo $FLAG_PART2 while in the container and you'll get that second half.
    Combine the two flags to one whole flag: jctfv{1n_h15 + _1nfallibl3_wak3}
