1. Listen to the file, they are DTMF tone (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency). They should sound familiar, they are the sounds that a telephone make when you enter a digit.
Note: This may be guessy but you could easily google "What are telephone tones" or "sound of digits telephone make" on Google and find the answer. However, I will include the hint of "What are the sounds called when you enter in digits on an older telephones called"

2. Go online to your DMTF decoder, any will work I used this one: https://dtmf.netlify.app/

3. You will be given a series of ASCII characters, go to your favorite decoder and decode it, I used this: https://www.dcode.fr/ascii-code

Note: Dcode can also analyze the cipher or encoding if you were unsure what type of encoding it was

4. After translating it you will get binary, translate that back to ascii and you will get the flag
Note: The reason it goes back to ascii is because the DMTF maps tones to ascii characters
