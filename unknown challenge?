Solution Steps
Note in my solution steps I specify the full path for the files

REDACTED

REDACTED

Upon opening the file you will see the entire user folder for johndoe

The encrypted flag and additional files are located in C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop. This directory contains the flag.txt.ecc file.

You need to do some OSINT. First, figure out which malware threat group hit the machine. There are plenty of websites to validate but I used:

https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/


Once there upload the ransom note HELP_TO_DECRYPT_YOUR_FILES.txt and the flag.txt.ecc file. It will tell you that your machine has been infected with TeslaCryptXXX. Then it will tell you that there is a decryption tool available for it.

If you click on the link it will redirect you to an article which explains step by step how to decrypt the encrypted files.

Download the zip

Now that you have the zip, you need to understand the tool. Yes there was a master decryption key released, however, it does not work for all versions. And the version of the ransomware is unknown. After researching a little, you will see that the tool can also use the key.dat file that gets installed when the malware encrypts the files.

Research where teslacrypt usually stores the key.dat file (C:\Users\johndoe%APPDATA%\roaming) and copy it off the image along with flag.txt.ecc if you have not done so already.

Using the tesla decoder tool that you downloaded off of the forum, you want to "Load data file" select the key.dat file you just took off the compromised machine.

Finally, after you load the data file, select Decrypt folder and select the folder with the encrypted file. It will decrypt the file and you have the flag.

Rabbit Holes
The master encryption key posted online will not work for this ransomware

The other encrypted files have no meaning, I just put them their for effect.

The link file in the Desktop folder is a hint for the participants on the malware type

I could not get most of the online decryption tools for the AV companies to work
