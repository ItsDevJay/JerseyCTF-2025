The challenge description strongly hints at a canary guarding a buffer
overflow, and reversing the binary this is exactly what we find. Our goal is
to turn "DEADRICE" into "DEADBEEF", but there is a canary in between the
buffer and the desired overflow spot. 

It's not immediately clear exactly where it is - I had to mess around with
the binary in GDB for a bit - but what is interesting is that it turns out 
the canary is only one byte long, and generated by a random function xor 100.
I didn't feel like looking too hard at whether the randomness is recreatable,
but with 100 possible random values, it's easy to just try all the possible 
values of the canary a bunch of times until we succeed in preserving the 
canary.
