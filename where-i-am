The challenge description hints that we want to use what3words.com to locate
a photograph. In the actual photo, a couple of things are key:

1. The US and Texas flags are clearly visible in front of the hotel.
2. "Aust" is visible on the parking banner, suggesting the picture is in
Austin, Texas.
3. The street name ends in "Springs", suggesting the location may have to do
with Barton Springs, a region in Austin.

While the location is not in Barton Springs, it is in the downtown area
located on Barton Springs Road. We can confirm this by looking at the hotels
in Austin.

Finally, we can locate the spot on the Yeti patio where the picture was taken
using satellite view.
