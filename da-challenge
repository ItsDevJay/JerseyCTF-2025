Solution Steps
This is a reference to Edward Coristine, of DOGE.
We hint at that with the 'doge in the fight' lien and by mentioning how young they are and by mentioning 'big balls'.
Kiwifarms lists a lot, see image.
This is confirmed across different sources. https://www.instagram.com/officialraptorsfanpage/p/Bx3FB6mhQHK/ This was his official raptors fan page where he listed himself as the account owner.
But his github is what we're looking for.
His username was edwardwc on github, proprietor of diamondcdn.
His maternal grandfather was Valery F. Martynov. The F is for Fedorovich or Fyodorovich.
I rely on this affidavit for spelling of Fedorovich, but also took the traditional spelling as well for the Ruskies playing.
His maternal great-grandfather was Fyodor, which is where the Fyodorovich comes from.
In Russia, the patronymic is the father's name, and the matronymic is the mother's name. So his great-grandfather's name was Fedor or Fyodor.

The accepted flag used regex so really you only need jctfv{edwardwc_vfm_f[e/y]}, with the last name being fe or fy followed by whatever you'd like. This was done to prevent issues with spelling based on regionality
