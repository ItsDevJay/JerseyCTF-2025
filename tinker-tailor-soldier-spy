Solution Steps

    Few key parts here:
        First, tinker tailor soldier spy , but not a tinker? Hercules Mulligan fought in a battle, but he was also a tailor and spy in the American Revolution.
        Second, "the spy would mark the spot", referencing the "marker"... aka a historical marker.
        However, if that wasn't clear, they could just search "disparaging remarks about his father" and duel, which shows Philip Hamilton as the second result. That said, these were my steps:

    Path One:
        Start by searching for "first spies in us history"
        End up on the wikipedia for List of American Spies.
        See Hercules Mulligan, find a historical marker for them
        Head to the Historical Marker Database
        Search each one, sure, but the first one listed in Herculues Mulligan who was a tailor and spy

    Path Two:
        Search for "disparaging remarks about his father" and duel.
        Find Philip Hamilton's historical marker
        This states he has 8 others within walking distance, but Heruclues Mulligan is only a few steps away.

    Once you find the marker it provides coordinates in DMS, but we need DD

    40° 42.47′ N, 74° 0.739′ W converts to 40.707833, -74.012317 in google. Other platforms may incorrectly round which provides borked coordinates. So you've gotta check your work. Of course, just googling the coords would get you there.

    The flag is Mulligan, 40.707833, -74.012317 (but no spaces, as the format states)
